# Automated-Plant-Watering-Cum-Monitoring-System
Objective:
Our project aims to maintain optimal soil moisture for healthy plant growth using sensors that monitor moisture, temperature, and environmental conditions, triggering watering as needed. The system provides real-time plant health monitoring, allowing early issue detection and reducing manual watering efforts.

Introduction:
Automation simplifies our lives, reducing the need for manual tasks. Our Automated Plant Watering and Monitoring System automates plant watering and tracks growth conditions. Sensors monitor soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, while a microcontroller manages the watering process. This system saves time, ensures correct watering, and alerts users to plant issues, promoting healthy growth with minimal effort, especially useful for large gardens or farms.

Motivation:
The system addresses the challenges of maintaining healthy plants, especially in suboptimal conditions or when human intervention is limited. Manual watering is time-consuming and prone to errors. Different plants require specific care, and environmental factors complicate consistent maintenance. Automation provides reliable watering and monitoring, reducing plant stress and promoting healthy growth, maximizing crop yields, and offering an efficient, sustainable plant care solution.

Project Overview:
We designed an Automated Plant Watering and Monitoring System prototype using an Arduino microcontroller. The system includes sensors for soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, a water pump, and a water reservoir. The Arduino reads sensor data and controls the water pump based on preset moisture thresholds. Key components include:

Soil Moisture Sensor: Detects soil moisture levels, providing analog output to the Arduino.
Temperature and Humidity Sensor: Sends digital signals to the Arduino indicating current conditions.
Display: Shows soil moisture, temperature, and humidity levels.
Relay Module: Controls the motor pump, switching it on or off as needed.
Motor Pump: Delivers water to plants when activated by the relay.
Arduino: Central controller reading sensor data and managing the relay module.
Program: Arduino code that reads sensor data and controls watering based on moisture levels, adjusting for temperature and humidity.

Data Flow Diagram
A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) is a visual representation of the flow of data within an information system. It illustrates the incoming data flow, outgoing data flow, and stored data in a graphical format.

Demonstration

Here, we explain how to get the system to work. This project is very easy to use.
Step 1:
Set up the soil moisture sensor: Place the soil moisture sensor in the soil of the plant you want to monitor. The sensor should be placed at a depth where the roots are actively absorbing water.

Step 2:
Turn on the system: Once everything is set up, turn on the automated plant watering system. The system should automatically water the plant when the soil moisture level falls below the desired level.
